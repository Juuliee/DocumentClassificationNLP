# Document Classification With Natural Language Processing
-----------------

## About
In this blog post I go over the topic of [document classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification) also known as [text classification](https://monkeylearn.com/text-classification/).  I will be working with the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-learn</a> library and using an imbalanced dataset that I create from summaries of papers published on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org). The topic of each paper is given a category alleviating the need to label the dataset.  I create an imbalance in the number of topics I train on as having imbalanced makes the developing a good model more challenging, but it is also more realistic. Imbalanced classes often occur in classification problems and may times it is too expensive or not possible to get more data on the classes that have to few samples. Developing strategies for dealing with imbalanced data is paramount for creating good classification models.  We will cover some of the basics of dealing with imbalanced data using the [Imbalance-Learn](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.  We also over the basics of term frequency-inverse document frequency, stop words, lemmatization using the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) as well as using Naive Bayes classifier from <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">Scikit-learn</a> .
